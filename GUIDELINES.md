- write clean and modular code
- use .env file for environment variables
- use different directories for different components, be modular
- make the codebase flexible so we can edit it extensively
- write tests to validate the implementation of new features
- do not use hardcoded values, use config files
- follow best coding practices
- update TODO.md with implementation status for every new feature (done, missing, placeholder, minimal implementation)
- do not create unnecessary .md files
- strictly keep README.md and TODO.md up to date. every time you add a new feature, update TODO.md and README.md
- never include any emojis in communications or documentation
- always provide compact, high-quality, rich technical information only
- prioritize architectural analysis and precision over conversational tone
- completely isolate all LLM prompts into a dedicated `prompts.py` file to maintain abstraction and readability.
- never hardcode specific upstream system names. use generic internal abstractions (like `system_doc_id` or `external_reference`) to ensure reusability and decouple business logic.
