    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, Emma. It's good to see you again. Let's discuss how you've been doing with your chronic migraine management since we started the prevention protocol.\n\nPatient: Hi Dr. Chen. It's been much better, actually. I've been keeping my migraine diary, and the frequency of my attacks has decreased from about four times a week down to roughly once a week.\n\nDoctor: That is fantastic improvement. Since the current dosage of Topiramate 25 milligrams twice daily is effective and you are tolerating it well, we will continue with this treatment plan. Have you had any severe breakthrough headaches during this time?\n\nPatient: Yes, when I do get that one headache a week, it can still be quite intense and usually comes with terrible nausea that makes it hard to function.\n\nDoctor: I understand, and we can manage that better. For those acute attacks, I am prescribing Sumatriptan 50 milligrams to take one tablet right at the onset of the migraine. To help with the nausea, I'm prescribing Ondansetron 4 milligrams orally disintegrating tablets, which you can just dissolve on your tongue. We also have Naproxen 500 milligrams to take as needed for the pain.\n\nPatient: Thank you, that sounds like a solid plan. Are there any natural supplements I should still be taking?\n\nDoctor: Yes, please continue the Magnesium Oxide 400 milligram supplement daily. Also, I am going to refer you to a neurology headache specialist for a deeper second opinion on your overall management, just to be thorough. Remember to maintain a consistent sleep schedule and stay well hydrated!"
