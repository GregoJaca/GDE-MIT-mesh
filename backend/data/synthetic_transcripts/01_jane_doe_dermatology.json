    "transcript": "Hello Jane. Today we are doing a follow-up evaluation of the pigmented lesion on your right forearm that you mentioned last week. Looking at it through the dermoscope, the lesion is about 4 millimeters wide. It is asymmetrical and has irregular borders. Comparing it to the earlier consult note, it seems to have changed slightly. I see an atypical network here. Because of these features, I recommend an excisional biopsy to rule out melanoma. It's a quick procedure we can schedule for next week. I am also referring you to a surgical oncologist specialist for a consultation regarding this lesion. For your care at home, I am prescribing Mupirocin 2 percent ointment to apply to the affected area three times daily for 7 days, and a Chlorhexidine 4 percent wash to use once daily as a skin cleanser. I am also prescribing Ibuprofen 400mg, which you can take one tablet every 6 hours as needed for any pain after the biopsy. In the meantime, please remember our counseling on sun protection and continue doing your regular skin self-examinations."
