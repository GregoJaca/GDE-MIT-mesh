    "transcript": "Doctor: Hello, Jane. How have you been since our last review of that pigmented lesion on your right forearm?\n\nPatient: Hi Doctor. Honestly, I'm a bit nervous. I feel like it's gotten slightly darker over the past week, and it's starting to itch mildly.\n\nDoctor: Okay, let's take a look. Ah, I see what you mean. Given that it has irregular borders and has changed recently, I strongly recommend we proceed with an excisional biopsy today to be absolutely safe.\n\nPatient: I agree. Will it hurt, or will it leave a big scar? I just want to know how to take care of it right after the procedure is done.\n\nDoctor: Don't worry, we'll use local anesthesia so you won't feel anything during the excision. The scar should be minimal. For aftercare, I am prescribing Mupirocin 2% Ointment; apply it to the affected area 3 times daily for 7 days. Also, use Chlorhexidine 4% Wash once daily as a skin cleanser around the area to prevent infection.\n\nPatient: Thank you, I'll pick those up. Should I expect much pain after the anesthesia wears off?\n\nDoctor: There might be some mild discomfort. I'm also prescribing Ibuprofen 400mg—take 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed for pain. Please schedule a follow-up in two weeks so we can remove the sutures and go over the biopsy results together."
