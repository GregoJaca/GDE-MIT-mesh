    "transcript": "Hi Michael. Let's take a look at that right knee. I understand from the ER triage notes from three days ago that you had a skiing accident. You mentioned feeling a pop, which is concerning. On examination, I feel a moderate effusion here. Let me perform the Lachman test... yes, there is laxity, and I also note joint line tenderness. Based on this, I suspect either an ACL tear or a meniscus injury. We need to order an MRI of the right knee immediately to confirm. In the meantime, I am prescribing some NSAIDs for the pain. You must use crutches and keep minimal weight bearing on that leg until we review the MRI results."
