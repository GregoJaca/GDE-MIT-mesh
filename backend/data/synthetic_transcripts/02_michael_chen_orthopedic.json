    "transcript": "Doctor: Good morning, Michael. I read the triage notes from the ER regarding your skiing incident. How is your right knee feeling today?\n\nPatient: Hi Doctor. It's incredibly swollen and painful. I can't put any weight on it at all without it feeling unstable. It felt like my knee just buckled under me on the mountain.\n\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Based on the swelling and the 'pop' you described, we are looking at a possible meniscus injury or an ACL tear. I'm ordering an MRI immediately to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nPatient: That makes sense. Is there anything I can take for the pain right now? The over-the-counter stuff isn't doing enough.\n\nDoctor: Yes, absolutely. I am prescribing Celecoxib 200mg—take one capsule daily for the inflammation. Since you mentioned muscle spasms around the joint, I'm also prescribing Cyclobenzaprine 5mg to take one tablet at bedtime as needed.\n\nPatient: Thank you. What if the pain gets really severe during the day while I wait for the MRI?\n\nDoctor: For severe breakthrough pain, I am prescribing Tramadol 50mg, take 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed. Because you'll be on NSAIDs, which can upset the stomach, please also take Pantoprazole 40mg—1 tablet daily before breakfast to protect your stomach lining. Let's touch base as soon as the MRI is back."
