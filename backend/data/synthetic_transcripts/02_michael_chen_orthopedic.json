    "transcript": "Hi Michael. Let's take a look at that right knee. I understand from the ER triage notes from three days ago that you had a skiing accident. You mentioned feeling a pop, which is concerning. On examination, I feel a moderate effusion here. Let me perform the Lachman test... yes, there is laxity, and I also note joint line tenderness. Based on this, I suspect either an ACL tear or a meniscus injury. We need to order an MRI of the right knee immediately to confirm. Because of the severity, I am going to refer you to an orthopedic surgery specialist for a consultation on possible ligament repair. I am prescribing several medications for you today: Celecoxib 200 milligrams to take one capsule daily, Cyclobenzaprine 5 milligrams to take one tablet at bedtime as needed for muscle spasms, Tramadol 50 milligrams to take one tablet every 6 hours as needed for severe pain, and Pantoprazole 40 milligrams to take one tablet daily before breakfast to protect your stomach. You must use crutches and keep minimal weight bearing on that leg until we review the MRI results."
